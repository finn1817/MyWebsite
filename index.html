            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I currently go to Fredonia University, and I am a graduate of Bishop Timon St. Jude High School. I am going to school for Computer Science. My interest in computer science as a whole has driven me to finish more advanced courses in C++, C#, and also in cybersecurity, focusing on networking with routers and switches, and a ton of other security essentials. I have also completed intro courses in Python, HTML, Assembly Language, and some classes focusing on solely data structures, which have all enhanced my programming skills</p>
            <p>I really do enjoy the challenge of problem solving that coding offers. My daily drive of an hour just to school has built me a strong work ethic.</p>

        <section id="involvement">
            <h2>How I Have Been Involved</h2>
            <p>During high school, I was the captain of the soccer team and an active member of the AV club, where I gained both leadership and technical skills.</p>

        <section id="fun">
            <h2>What I Do for Fun</h2>
            <p>I enjoy doing tons of things from DoorDashing to playing video games. I'm also passionate about programming, whether that's for schoolwork or just as a hobby. I also spend some time working on my car, mostly trying to keep it from having issues on my drive to school but I do enjoy learning how to do it all myself!</p>
