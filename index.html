            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate of Bishop Timon St. Jude High School, where I had to honor to serve as the captain of the soccer team, demonstrating leadership and teamwork. My passion in computer science as a whole has driven me to finish more advanced courses in C++, C#, and also in cybersecurity, focusing on networking with routers and switched, and a ton of other security essentials. I have also completed intro courses in Python, HTML, assembly language, and some focusing on data structures, which have all benefited my programming skills and abilities.</p>
            <p>I really do enjoy the challenge of problem solving that coding offers. My daily drive of an hour just to school has built me a strong work ethic. I also enjoy having to maintain my car, as I handle almost all of its simple maintenance and repairs myself.</p>
